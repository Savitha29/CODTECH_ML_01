### Overview of the Project

**Name:** SAVITHA K <br>
**Company:** CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS <br>
**ID:** CT4ML6033 <br>
**Domain:** Machine Learning <br>
**Duration:** August 01, 2024 to September 01, 2024 <br>

### Objective

The objective of this project is to make a predictive model which uses linear regression on a dataset containing data of house prices in banagalore. The aim is to develop a model that can predict the price of a house based on various aspects of the house.

### Key Activities

- **Data Cleaning:** Ensuring the dataset is free from inconsistencies and missing values.
- **Model Building and Training:** Building a model and training it on the given data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the performance of the model to analyze its efficiency and accuracy in making predictions.

### Technologies used

- **Python**: The primary programming labguage for data science.
- **pandas**: Used for manipulation and analysis
- **numpy**: Used for manipulating arrays
- **sklearn**: Used for the model building, training and evaluating tasks.

This project provides a comprehensive overview of model making process for house price prediction. These models are useful for descision making.
